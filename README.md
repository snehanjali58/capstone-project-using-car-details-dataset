# capstone-project-using-car-details-dataset
Data Science project which performs EDA &  Build the Machine Learning Model. 

1. We have leran some insights from the dataset using the EXCEL.
2. Then performed the data preprocessing & cleaning.
3. I have done Exploratarty Data Analaysis ( EDA) using the graphical libraries like matplotlib, Seaborn & using Pandas. 
4. We have created the ML model to predict the selling price of the car based onto the other fetaures.
5. Tried the various regression model & choosed the best model among them & saved it using the pickle libarary.
6. Created the streamlit app & deployed the ML model onto it.

Below are the details of the file:-

1. CAR DETAILS.csv --> Contains the dataset
2. Data_preprocessing_Cleaning_Mlmodel --> Creation of the ML Model
3. EDA_Graphical_Analysis --> EDA
4. app.py --> Streamlit app
5. best_model.pkl --> Saved ML Model
6. project ppt --> Deatiled presenation onto thr project
